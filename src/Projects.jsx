            <p>
                As part of my coursework at <strong>Centennial College</strong>, I developed a website focusing on <strong>Alexa</strong> and real estate agents. This project allowed me to explore the integration of voice technology with real estate services, creating a user-friendly platform that enhances accessibility and communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website showcases features such as property listings, agent profiles, and voice command functionality. This project demonstrates my ability to combine innovative technology with practical applications in the real estate industry, highlighting my skills in web development and user experience design.
