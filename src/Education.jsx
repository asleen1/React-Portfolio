                    I completed my senior secondary education at <strong>Khalsa Senior Secondary School</strong> in Garhdiwala, India. During my time at Khalsa, I developed a strong academic foundation and a passion for learning that has continued to guide my educational journey. My experiences at the school fostered not only my academic skills but also my personal growth, preparing me for the challenges and opportunities I would encounter in higher education.

                <p>
                    At <strong>Centennial College</strong>, I have successfully completed two semesters, during which I have immersed myself in a diverse range of subjects and hands-on projects. The collegeâ€™s emphasis on practical learning and real-world applications has enhanced my understanding of various concepts in technology and software development. I appreciate the supportive learning environment and the opportunity to collaborate with peers and instructors, which has significantly enriched my educational experience. As I continue my journey into the third semester, I am excited to further expand my skills and knowledge in this dynamic field.
